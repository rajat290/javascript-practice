Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci series is a sequence of numbers in which each number is the sum of the two preceding numbers, starting from 0 and 1. This series is named after the Italian mathematician Leonardo Fibonacci, who introduced it in the 13th century as a solution to a problem involving the growth of a population of rabbits.

Properties of Fibonacci Series
Recursion: Each term in the series is the sum of the two preceding terms.
Starting values: The series starts with 0 and 1.
Infinite sequence: The Fibonacci series is an infinite sequence, meaning it has no end.
Example of Fibonacci Series
Here are the first 10 terms of the Fibonacci series:

0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, ...

How to Calculate Fibonacci Series
To calculate the Fibonacci series, you can use the following formula:

F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Where F(n) is the nth term in the series.

Example Calculation
Let's calculate the first 5 terms of the Fibonacci series:

F(0) = 0 (starting value)
F(1) = 1 (starting value)
F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1
F(3) = F(2) + F(1) = 1 + 1 = 2
F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3
Real-World Applications of Fibonacci Series
The Fibonacci series has many real-world applications, including:

Finance: Fibonacci numbers appear in the analysis of financial markets, particularly in the study of price movements and trading patterns.
Biology: Fibonacci numbers are found in the growth patterns of many living organisms, such as the branching of trees, the arrangement of leaves on stems, and the flowering of artichokes.
Computer Science: Fibonacci numbers are used in algorithms for solving problems related to recursion, dynamic programming, and data compression.
Architecture: Fibonacci numbers are used in the design of buildings, bridges, and oter structures to create aesthetically pleasing and efficient designs.
Interesting Facts about Fibonacci Series
Golden Ratio: The ratio of any two adjacent Fibonacci numbers approaches the golden ratio (approximately 1.618) as the series progresses.
Fibonacci Spiral: The Fibonacci series can be used to create a spiral pattern, known as the Fibonacci spiral, which appears in many natural forms, such as seashells and galaxies.
Fibonacci Numbers in Nature: Fibonacci numbers appear in many natural patterns, such as the arrangement of seeds in a sunflower, the branching of rivers, and the structure of DNA molecules.
