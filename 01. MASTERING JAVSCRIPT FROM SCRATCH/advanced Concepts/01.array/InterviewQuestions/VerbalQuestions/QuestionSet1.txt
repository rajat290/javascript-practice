1. What is the difference between array.length = 0 and array = []?

Answer:

array.length = 0 empties the existing array in-place (same reference remains).

array = [] creates a new array, replacing the old reference.

ðŸ”¥ In-place vs new reference â€” important in closures or shared memory.

2. Are arrays in JavaScript objects?

Answer:
Yes, arrays are special types of objects.
They have numeric indexes and a length property.

typeof [] === "object" returns true. Use Array.isArray() to check accurately.
