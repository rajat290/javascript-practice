 JavaScript me OOP kaise hota hai?

JS is not a class-based language originally — it's prototype-based.
But from ES6, we have class, constructor, extends, etc. which make OOP feel just like Java, C++, etc.

JS supports all the OOPs concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, polymorphism, etc.

4 Pillars of OOP in JavaScript
Yaad rakhne ka shortcut:
"A PIE" → Abstraction, Polymorphism, Inheritance, Encapsulation


1️⃣ Encapsulation – “Data ko pack karna”

✅ Easy Definition:
 Building of data and methods inside a single unit object or class 

🧠 Interview line:
 Encapsulation keeps code organized and prevents access to sensitive data 

 💡 Real-life Analogy:
Car — gear change karne ka function hai, par andar gearbox kaise kaam karta hai tu nahi dekhta.
