 it returns a promise that resolves to the response 


 fetch is used to make network requests and get from servers it return a promise which helps in handling async apis operations 


 2. Interview Line
“fetch() is my go-to method to call REST APIs in JavaScript. It’s promise-based, and I often pair it with async/await for cleaner syntax.”


 3. Why It’s Used
To get data from APIs (GET)

To send data to server (POST, PUT, DELETE)

To connect frontend with backend

Works in all modern browsers

4. Daily Life Analogy
Soch tu Zomato pe click karta hai "My Orders".
Tu expect karta hai ki Zomato server se tera data le aayega.

Tere browser ne fetch() kiya hota hai background me server se.
Jab data aata hai → dikhata hai.


 5. Technically How It Works

 fetch("https://api.example.com/data")
  .then(response => response.json()) // convert to usable format
  .then(data => console.log(data))   // handle data
  .catch(error => console.log(error)); // handle errors
