Topic: Arrow Functions in JavaScript

An arrow function is a shorter way to write a function 
they don't bind their own this so they are usefull when we want to use the this from the surrounding context 

suppose we are listing items in a cart 

const cart = ["Shirt", "T-shrt" , "cap"];

cart.forEach(item => {
    console.log("item:", item );
})

Arrow function is used to loop through the array and log each item â€” clean, short, and readable.

3. Real-life Use
Writing short, inline functions in array methods like map, filter, reduce

Automatically preserve this from outer scope (especially in classes, React components, etc.)
Improves readability & reduces boilerplate
