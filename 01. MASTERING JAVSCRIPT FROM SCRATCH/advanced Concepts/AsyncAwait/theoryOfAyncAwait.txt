Topic: Async and Await in JavaScript

 Definition (Easy & Interview-Friendly)
 =====================================
Async and await are the keywords in javaScript , which are used to do asynchronous programming in a synchronous looking way ,

They make promises easier to read and write .

2. ‚úÖ Interview Line (Memorize and Say)

Using async await , i can pause the eexecution untia a promise resolves ,without blocking the main thread , it helps me write cleaner and easier - to - debug asynchronous code 

3. ‚úÖ Why It‚Äôs Used
=====================================

To wait for a promise to resolve before moving ahead

To avoid .then() chaining (callback hell)

To handle API calls, timers, file I/O, or anything async, in a readable way

Makes debugging easier than using .then() or .catch()


4. ‚úÖ Daily Life Analogy
=====================================
Socho tu Zomato pe order karta hai.
Tu chahta hai ki:
"Khane ke aane ke baad hi khaana shuru karun."
Yehi kaam await karta hai ‚Äî vo function ruk jaata hai jab tak promise resolve na ho jaaye (yaani order aake deliver na ho jaaye).
Jab khaana aa jaata hai ‚Üí execution phir se chalu hoti hai.



5. Syntax 
=====================================
async function getData() {
    const result = await fetch(api.getdta.com/dumydata);
    const data = await result.json();
    return data;
}

 Behind the scenes:

 1. The function is marked as async, which means it can pause its execution and resume it later
 2. The await keyword is used to pause the execution of the function until the promise is resolved
 3. Once the promise is resolved, the execution of the function resumes and the result is returned

 in short 
 async function automatically returns a Promise

await pauses the execution until the Promise resolves

It does not block the main thread, it just makes the code wait logically

6.  Tricky Interview Questions to Practice Verbally

Q1: Can we use await inside a normal function?
‚ùå No, await only works inside an async function.

Q2: What does an async function return?
‚úÖ Always a Promise ‚Äî even if you return a value.

 Q3: Can we use multiple awaits in one function?
‚úÖ Yes, each one will pause until its promise resolves.

Q4: Does await block the entire program?
‚ùå No. It only pauses execution within the async function, not globally.

Q5: What happens if we don‚Äôt use await before a promise?

üîÅ The function won‚Äôt wait ‚Äî it will move ahead immediately with a pending promise.
