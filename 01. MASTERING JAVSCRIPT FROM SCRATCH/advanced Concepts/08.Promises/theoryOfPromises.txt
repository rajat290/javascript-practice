Topic: Promises in JavaScript

A promise in javaScript is an object that represents the future result either pass or fail of an async operation 

“A Promise is a placeholder for a value that will be available later. It helps in handling asynchronous operations like API calls, file loads, etc.”

 2. Interview Line
“Promises give us a cleaner and more manageable way to handle async code, avoiding callback hell. They have 3 states: pending, fulfilled, and rejected.”


 3. Why It’s Used
To handle asynchronous operations

To avoid callback hell / pyramid of doom

To improve readability and error handling



4. Daily Life Analogy
Soch tu Swiggy pe order place karta hai.
Tere haath me aata hai ek “Promise”:

Order aayega ✅ (fulfilled)

Cancel ho gaya ❌ (rejected)

Abhi process me hai ⏳ (pending)

 5. Technically How It Works


const myPromise = new Promise((resolve, reject) => {
  let success = true;

  if (success) {
    resolve("Data received");
  } else {
    reject("Error occurred");
  }
});

myPromise
  .then((res) => console.log("Success:", res))
  .catch((err) => console.log("Failed:", err));



Breakdown:

new Promise() returns a promise

It takes a function with resolve and reject

Based on logic, either one is called

.then() handles success

.catch() handles failure

6. Common Mistakes / Interview Traps
❌ Mistake 1: Thinking Promise runs synchronously
It starts immediately but resolves asynchronously


❌ Mistake 2: Not returning a value in .then()

.then(res => {
  console.log(res); // good
})
.then(x => console.log(x)); // x will be undefined unless previous return


❌ Mistake 3: Forgetting .catch()
Promises that fail without a .catch() → unhandled promise rejection



✅ 7. Tricky Verbal Questions (Interview Traps)


 Q1: How many states does a Promise have?
3 — pending, fulfilled, rejected

❓ Q2: Can you chain .then()?
✅ Yes. Each .then() returns a new Promise.

❓ Q3: What happens if I return a Promise from inside .then()?
The outer .then() will wait for the inner one to resolve

❓ Q4: What's the difference between Promise and async/await?
async/await is just syntactic sugar built on top of Promises.
