WHAT ARE THE VARIABLES IN JS

VARIABLES ARE THE WAY TO STORE SOME DATA IN IT 
IT IS LIKE A CONTAINER TO FILL DATA 

=======================================================

🧠 1. Definition (Easy & Interview-Friendly)
Variables are containers for storing data values.
In JavaScript, we declare variables using var, let, or const.

✅ Interview line:
“Variables in JS are memory containers used to store data, and their behavior depends on how we declare them — using var, let, or const.”


🤔 2. Why It’s Used 
Variables are the foundation of any programming logic — you store values like numbers, strings, arrays, or objects and use them later in your logic.

🧃 Daily life analogy:

Socho tumhare paas ek fridge hai (variable), usme doodh, bread, butter rakhte ho (data). Jab zarurat hoti hai — fridge kholke use kar lete ho.

⚙️ 3. How It Works
Let’s break it down by type:

Feature | var | let | const
Scope | Function-scoped | Block-scoped | Block-scoped
Re-declaration | Allowed | ❌ Not Allowed | ❌ Not Allowed
Re-assignment | Allowed | Allowed | ❌ Not Allowed
Hoisting | ✅ Hoisted (undefined init) | ✅ Hoisted (TDZ error) | ✅ Hoisted (TDZ error)

🧠 TDZ = Temporal Dead Zone (Time between hoisting and initialization where accessing variable throws error)


🧪 4. Syntax + ExampleS

// var - globally/function scoped
var a = 10;
a = 20; // allowed
var a = 30; // allowed

// let - block scoped
let b = 15;
b = 25; // allowed
// let b = 35; // ❌ SyntaxError: Identifier 'b' has already been declared

// const - block scoped
const c = 50;
// c = 60; // ❌ Error: Assignment to constant variable
// const c = 70; // ❌ Error: Already declared


⚠️ 5. Common Mistakes / Interview Traps
❌ Using var in loops or block scopes

❌ Thinking const makes object/array immutable (only binding is constant)

const user = { name: "Ravi" };
user.name = "Amit"; // ✅ Allowed
// user = { name: "Shyam" }; // ❌ Not allowed


💪 6. Mini Practice Task

👉 Predict output 👇

console.log(x);
var x = 10;

console.log(y);
let y = 20;


 Expected output
 undefined
❌ ReferenceError: Cannot access 'y' before initialization


🧠 7. Recap (1-line Summary)

Use let and const for modern JS — var is outdated due to scoping issues.
const is for values that won’t change, let for values that will.
