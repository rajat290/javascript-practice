Mid-Level Topic 3: Local Storage — one of the most common frontend interview questions and real project tools


 1. Easy & Interview-Friendly Definition

 Local Storage is a browser feature that allows you to store key-value pairs of data on the user’s computer.
It’s persistent — data stays even after page refresh or closing the browser.

✅ 2. Interview Line
Local storage helps in storing small amounts of data (5MB max) on the client side without any expiration time. It’s part of the Web Storage API.


✅ 3. Why It’s Used
To save user preferences, theme settings, or tokens.

Keeps user logged in (e.g. storing JWT).

Avoids extra server calls by caching static data.

Great for offline-first apps.

✅ 4. Daily Life Example
Just like a fridge magnet note — localStorage is like putting a sticky note on the fridge (browser) — it's always there until you remove it manually.

✅ 5. Key Methods to Remember
Method	Purpose
localStorage.setItem('key', value)	Store data
localStorage.getItem('key')	Read data
localStorage.removeItem('key')	Delete a key
localStorage.clear()	Clear all data

✅ 6. Code Examples
✅ Save Data

localStorage.setItem("username", "rajat");
✅ Get Data

let user = localStorage.getItem("username"); 
console.log(user); // rajat
✅ Remove Specific Item

localStorage.removeItem("username");
✅ Clear Everything

localStorage.clear();
✅ 7. Bonus: Store Complex Data like Arrays or Objects
js
Copy code
let user = { name: "Rajat", age: 25 };
localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(user)); // Save object

let data = JSON.parse(localStorage.getItem("user")); // Retrieve object
console.log(data.name); // Rajat
✅ 8. Common Interview Mistakes to Avoid
❌ localStorage stores only strings — always stringify objects.

❌ It's synchronous — avoid storing large data.

❌ Don’t store passwords or sensitive data — it’s visible to users via dev tools.

❌ localStorage is domain-specific — only accessible by the same domain.
