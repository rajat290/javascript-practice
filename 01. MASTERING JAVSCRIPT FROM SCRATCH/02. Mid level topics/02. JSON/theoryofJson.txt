Topic 2: JSON (JavaScript Object Notation)

JSON is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data , especially between a clien t (browser) and a server (API) , it looks like a js object but is in string format.

JSON is used to store data in a structured format, it is easy to read and write, and
it is language independent.

✅ 2. Interview Line
JSON is a lightweight data format used to store and exchange data between a client and a server.


JSON is the standard format for APIs to send and receive data between frontend and backend in a readable and structured way.


✅ 3. Why It’s Used

To exchange data between systems in a universal format.

Works across all programming languages, not just JavaScript.

Super lightweight and human-readable.

Used heavily in APIs and databases like MongoDB.


 4. Daily Life Analogy
Think of JSON like a Google Form submission — when you fill it, the form sends your info (name, email, etc.) to Google in a fixed structured format — that's what JSON does with your data.

✅ 5. Technically How It Works

JSON Format Looks Like

{
  "name": "Rajat",
  "age": 25,
  "skills": ["JavaScript", "React"]
}


✅ But remember: It’s a string, not a real object.



📥 Converting JSON to JavaScript Object


let jsonStr = '{"name":"Rajat","age":25}';
let jsObj = JSON.parse(jsonStr);  // JSON → Object
console.log(jsObj.name); // Rajat


📤 Converting JavaScript Object to JSON

let obj = { name: "Rajat", age: 25 };
let json = JSON.stringify(obj);   // Object → JSON
console.log(json); // '{"name":"Rajat","age":25}'


 6. Common Mistakes / Interview Traps

 ❗Trap 1: Is JSON a data type in JS?
❌ No, it’s a string format (even though it looks like an object).

❗Trap 2: Can you put comments in JSON?
❌ No. JSON does not allow comments. It’s strict.

❗Trap 3: Difference between JSON.stringify() and JSON.parse()?
stringify: Converts Object → JSON string

parse: Converts JSON string → Object

❗Trap 4: Can functions or undefined be in JSON?
❌ No. JSON only supports text, numbers, booleans, null, arrays, and objects. No functions or undefined.
