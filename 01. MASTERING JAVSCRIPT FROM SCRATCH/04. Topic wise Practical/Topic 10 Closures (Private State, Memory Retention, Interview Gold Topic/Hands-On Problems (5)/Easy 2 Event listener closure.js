function attachhandler () {
    //This defines a new function named attachhandler. The function takes no arguments.
    let clicks = 0;
    // Inside the attachhandler function, a local variable clicks is declared and initialized to 0. This variable is used to keep track of the number of times a button has been clicked.
document.getElementById("btn").
   //This line gets a reference to an HTML element with the id btn using the document.getElementById method.

addEventListener("click", 
    // An event listener is attached to the button element for the click event. When the button is clicked, the provided function is executed.
    function(){
    clicks++;
    console.log("Button clicked " + clicks + " times");
});
/*This is the function that will be executed when the click event is triggered. It does two things:

Increments the clicks variable by 1 using the ++ operator.
Logs a message to the console indicating how many times the button has been clicked.*/

}
attachhandler();
// The attachhandler function is called to set up the event listener on the button. This means that every time the button is clicked, the inner function will run, updating and logging the click count.



/*

This line calls the attachhandler function, which sets up the event listener and initializes the clicks variable.

Here's what happens when the button is clicked:

The event listener is triggered, and the event handler function is executed.
The clicks variable is incremented by 1.
A message is logged to the console indicating the new click count.
Because the clicks variable is declared inside the attachhandler function, it is preserved across multiple calls to the event handler function. This means that the click count will be accurate even if the button is clicked multiple times.

In summary:

The attachhandler function sets up an event listener on an HTML element with the id btn.
The event listener increments a local variable clicks and logs a message to the console each time the button is clicked.
The clicks variable is preserved across multiple calls to the event handler function, allowing the click count to be accurate.qwq
