A caallback function is passed as an argument into another function executed later after the main task is done 

2. Why it is used?

Callbacks allow JavaScript (which is single-threaded) to handle async operations like fetching data, file reading, timers, etc., without blocking the main thread.

👉 Daily life analogy: You order pizza 🍕, leave your number (callback). Restaurant calls you back when ready → You don’t stand idle waiting.
