21. What is the difference between an object and an array in JavaScript?
answer-
In JavaScript, an object and an array are two distinct data types. An object is a collection of
key-value pairs, where each key is a string and each value can be any data type, including
objects, arrays, and functions. An array, on the other hand, is a collection of values
that can be of any data type, including strings, numbers, booleans, objects, and functions

21.2. What is the difference between a function and a method in JavaScript?
answer-
In JavaScript, a function and a method are two related but distinct concepts. A function is a
block of code that can be executed multiple times from different parts of a program. A
method is a function that is associated with an object and is called on that object. In other words
, a method is a function that is a property of an object.

 22. How do you clone an object or array in JavaScript?
 answer-
 You can clone an object or array in JavaScript using the spread operator (...) or the JSON.parse(JSON.stringify
 ) method. The spread operator creates a shallow copy of the object or array, while the JSON.pars
 (JSON.stringify) method creates a deep copy.

 23. What are object methods like Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries()?
 answer-
 Object methods like Object.keys(), Object.values(), and Object.entries() are used to
 extract information from objects. Object.keys() returns an array of the object's keys, Object.values()
 returns an array of the object's values, and Object.entries() returns an array of the object's
 entries (key-value pairs).

 24. How does the map() method work in JavaScript, and when would you use it?
 answer-
 The map() method is a higher-order function that applies a given function to each element of an array
 and returns a new array with the results. You would use the map() method when you need to
 transform an array of values into a new array with different values.
