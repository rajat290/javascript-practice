 13. What is async/await, and how does it simplify asynchronous code in JavaScript?
 Async/await is a syntax sugar for working with promises. It allows you to write asynchronous code that
 looks and feels like synchronous code, making it easier to read and maintain.

 14. What are the advantages of using async functions over callbacks?
